# JavaAssignment02
Just an assignment I had to do for my java class
nothing special. just asks the user for how many random numbers they want to generate.
with that it writes it to a file and also generates the same amount of gaussian numbers.
then displays a bar chart of the gaussian numbers. also all are writen to  a text file.
